is really nice that you put in warnings for cases that are not doable (yet)!!!\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding one warning: \r\n`Only one VictoryAxis component of each axis type is allowed when using the VictoryChart wrapper. Only the first axis will be used. Please compose multi-axis charts manually`\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you mean by `Please compose multi-axis charts manually`\r\nThat it should be done outside the VictoryChart component in an svg, or could it be in another VictoryChart wrapper component?\r\n\r\nAnd what exactly is an \"axis type\"? Is the type defined by the `orientation` prop?\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is a bit trouble some to get rid of the default axis for me. Is it right now possible to have an axis at the right and at the top without the other two?\r\n\r\nSomehow I also cannot manage to set tickValue to something independent of x or y, should that be doable?\r\n\r\nLastly, I recognized two things about axis, they somehow influence each other sometime, e.g. left and bottom and order of VictoryAxis components matters.\r\n\r\nI highly appreciate your work on this project and hope to be able to contribute in a more constructive way than pinpointing oddities and asking questions.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if you get the time to reply to the questions.\r\nHave a nice weekend!"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-11-27T15:43:28Z","org":{"id":5078602,"login":"FormidableLabs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/FormidableLabs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078602?"}},{"id":"3386144694","type":"WatchEvent","actor":{"id":1725705,"login":"ssy341","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssy341","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1725705?"},"repo":{"id":4640263,"name":"dbushell/Nestable","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dbushell/Nestable"},"payload":{"action":"started"},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-11-27T15:43:27Z"},{"id":"3386144691","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":24171,"login":"badal","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badal","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24171?"},"repo":{"id":38571493,"name":"badal/jacman-qtbase","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/badal/jacman-qtbase"},"payload":{"push_id":881953998,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/master","head":"8cfbd5acf9694f7f69750e015250f6f2f1b82da0","before":"71153c08c30c33c13c6be5f69547af69b599bf2a","commits":[{"sha":"8cfbd5acf9694f7f69750e015250f6f2f1b82da0","author":{"email":"michel@demazure.com","name":"Michel
