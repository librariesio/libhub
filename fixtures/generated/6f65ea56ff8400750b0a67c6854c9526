I first came across it when I tried to deploy to heroku. The build kept failing with a compile failure\r\n\r\nError: Undefined variable: \"$dl-horizontal-breakpoint\".\r\n\r\nI wasn't getting this locally which really threw me. My guess was it might be due to some variation in the way the dependencies are being pulled in. While looking through the way my dependencies are defined I decided to upgrade my app from 1.13.8 to 1.13.13 and I'm now seeing the same error locally\r\n\r\nFile: /Users/conornugent/Dev/neighbourwood/neighbourwood-portal/tmp/sass_compiler-input_base_path-5rryynkr.tmp/0/app/styles/bootstrap/_type.scss (210)\r\nUndefined variable: \"$dl-horizontal-breakpoint\".\r\nError: Undefined variable: \"$dl-horizontal-breakpoint\".\r\n\r\nIt looks like the bootstrap variable file and bootstrap in general isn't being complied properly anymore. Any ideas what might be up?
